## Description of the game
Super Soukoban is a game that consists on pushing a box above a sphere, but the way of pushing the boxes has to be the correct one, if there is any error, the player usually loses the game. In case that the player pushed the box to the wrong place near the wall, there is no way to stretch out of it.
